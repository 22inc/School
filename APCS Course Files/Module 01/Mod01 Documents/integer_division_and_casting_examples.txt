Integer Division in Java

 When dividing two integers in java, java performs two separate calculations.
/  →  Gives the integer quotient (result) of the division and ignores the remainder.

% → Gives the integer remainder of the division and ignores the quotient.


Example 1:
23 / 4 = 5 in java
23 goes into 4  a total of 5 times evenly
java ignores the remainder in this calculation 

23 % 4 = 3 in java
when you divide 23 by 4, the quotient is 5 and you have 3 left over (remainder).

Anytime 2 integers are divided in java, use one or both of the operators above depending on what you need (quotient or remainder).

Example 2:
29 / 5 = 5
29 % 5 = 4

Example 3:
30 / 6  =  5
30 % 6 = 0


If you divide an integer and a double, then the / symbol will give you a double as a result.

Example 1:
23.0 / 4 = 5.75  //double dividing an int gives a double for a result

Example 2:
23 / 4.0 = 5.75  //int dividing a double gives a double for a result

Example 3:
(double) 23 / 4 = 5.75   //23 is converted to a double before the division so the result is a double

Example 4:
(double)(23/4) = 5.0  
//the division happens first int / int = int result  which is then converted to a double
